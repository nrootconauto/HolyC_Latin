# HolyC Latin
  Welcome the the begining of my HolyC Latin,its based on old code i wrote awhile ago.

  It comes with a dump from the wiktionary in Latin.json.Z. `Visual.HC` is the file you'll want to run, `Dict.HC` will generate  a massive "INDEX.TRIE"(about 700M)index of the Latin.json(uncompressed 1.1G) file.

  Ill talk more later. Just look at the `Latin.GMR` if you want to contriubute. Making `Generator.HC` multicore would be cool too.

# Getting the Latin.json
